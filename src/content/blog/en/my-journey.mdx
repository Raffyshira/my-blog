## let's more deep dive about me, Shall we??

This journey started when I graduated from high school. I studied at MAN 3 Banyuwangi for 3 years. While scrolling through Instagram Reels on the Explore page, I came across a video that piqued my interest in web development. My curiosity grew even more as I explored numerous websites on [godly.com](https://godly.website/), many of which I found really cool.

Before I went into web development, I was a barista at a cafe for 4 months. Yeah, if we ever meet, I'll make a cup of latte for you. Back to the previous topic, I learned web development self-taught via YouTube and Chrome. The first time I studied web development, I made a personal portfolio about myself using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. At that time, I didn't know what React.js, JavaScript, TailwindCSS, and others were, I just like a child who doesn't know everything.

I learned React.js through the YouTube platform, specifically from the [FreeCodeCamp channel](https://youtube.com/@freecodecamp?si=zq2OWMAlzNhwlfEL), where [Bob Ziroll](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bobziroll), the head of education at [Scrimba](https://v2.scrimba.com/home), explains it. I learned a lot about React.js and am really grateful to that teacher. He explained everything in detail and clearly, ngl.

If you are interested in React.js, I recommend watching that video or searching for tutorials on https://www.freecodecamp.org/ You can find tutorials on various topics on that channel, including Python, C++, C, and many more.

## Fun facts about me, let's goo!!

I have created several websites from personal portfolios, websites for schools, and until this day a build a really complex website using [astro.js](https://astro.build/), you can see some of my projects on my [github repository](https://github.com/Raffyshira).

## A unique fact about me is that

When I make a project, people usually think i used a laptop. But actually, I made the website just using a android. Well, don't be too surprised. Many people still think you need a laptop to learn web development, but I think that's a misconception. I still can build a really cool website just using android. There are several reasons why I don't use a laptop, one of which is that I didn't have enough money to buy one. At that time, I thought needed a laptop to learn web development, so I looked for ways to learn without one. I remember a quote that said

> Where there's a will, there's a way

Up to this point, my learning progress has gone from knowing nothing to knowing a lot about web development. I've learned many things, and I hope my journey doesn't end here . I will continue to explore web development, Until this day i really see the progrees from the beginning not knowing to knowing.
