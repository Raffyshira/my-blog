## What is Astro?

Astro is a JavaScript web framework optimized for faster development and content-driven websites.

## What are the Advantages of Astro.js?

**1. Server-first**

One of Astro.js’s standout features is its server-first approach. Astro.js enhances website performance by rendering components on the server first, converting them into lightweight HTML, and sending them to the browser without JavaScript. This results in significant performance improvements and better SEO.

**2. Content-Driven**

As mentioned earlier, Astro.js is content-driven. It is designed to excel in content creation, pulling data from your file system, APIs, or CMS (Content Management System). Astro.js is similar to WordPress but allows for extensive customization without sacrificing its content authoring features.

**3. Customizable**

You can customize Astro.js with your favorite tools, including using JavaScript UI components, CSS libraries, themes, and integrations. I recommend using [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for your projects.

## Astro Islands

This unique feature of Astro.js optimizes your website in ways other web frameworks don’t. Astro Islands can improve your page load performance, conversion rates, Core Web Vitals, and SEO (Search Engine Optimization).

## Flexibility

Astro supports all UI frameworks, so you can use React, Vue, Preact, Svelte, and Solid in a single project. This flexibility is a significant advantage, allowing you to integrate various frameworks seamlessly within your Astro.js project.

```astro
---
import BuyButton from '../components/BuyButton.jsx';
import BuyButton from '../components/BuyButton.vue';
import BuyButton from '../components/BuyButton.svelte';

import { getProductDetails } from "ecommerce-package";
import ProductPageLayout from '../layouts/ProductPageLayout.astro';

const product = await getProductDetails(Astro.params.slug);
---

<ProductPageLayout>
  <img src={product.imageUrl} alt={product.imageAlt} />
  <h2>{product.name}</h2>
  <BuyButton id={product.id} client:load />
</ProductPageLayout>
```

## Setting Up an Astro Project

Before installing, ensure your laptop or PC meets the following requirements:

- **Node.js** - Version <mark>v18.17.1</mark> or <mark>v20.3.0</mark> (latest supported versions). Note that <mark>v19</mark> is not yet supported, so make sure your Node.js version is compatible with Astro.js.
- **Text Editor** - I recommend using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), which has an [official Astro plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=astro-build.astro-vscode).
- **Terminal** - Access Astro via the command-line interface (CLI).

## Installing from the CLI

1. Run the following command in your terminal to start an Astro.js project:

```bash
# Create a project using npm
npm create astro@latest
```

You can also install using pnpm or yarn. Run the <mark>create astro</mark> command in your terminal and follow the prompts. If you skip the <mark>npm install</mark> step, you can still install later, but make sure to do so.

Once everything is set up, you can start the [Astro dev server](https://docs.astro.build/en/install-and-setup/#start-the-astro-dev-server) and begin coding!

## Starter Templates

If you want a quicker setup, you can use templates provided by Astro. Check them out [here](https://astro.build/themes).

To use a template from Astro or a GitHub repository, follow these steps:

```bash
# Create a new project with an official example
npm create astro@latest -- --template <example-name>

# Create a new project based on a GitHub repository’s main branch
npm create astro@latest -- --template <github-username>/<github-repo>
```

Finally, you can start the Astro development server with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Astro will start your project server at http://localhost:4321/. Visit the link and start coding!
